# Brandeis Class Hub

Lu Hao, David Shapiro, Jiefang Li, Jason Gordon

### Summary

Generally, our product is a merger of a calendar and a ToDo/Task Manager App. We'll use Brandeis' APIs and Workday's .csv exporting capabilities to organize where classes are, when classes are, and display this all on a calendar including Brandeis Holidays. We'll also allow users to create tasks and put them on a calendar and in a To-Do list with alarms, alerting the users when the task they need is. They can also set alarms independently to the calendar for class reminders.
